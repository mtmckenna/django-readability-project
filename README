This is a skeleton project for a Readability webapp using the Django framework.  It is quite basic and leaves a lot left to do.

The app works like this:
* User goes to example.com/login and is taken to Readability's site to authorize or deny the webapp's access.
* After the webapp has been authorized, the user is sent to the callback URL where an account for that user is created in the database.
* A user profile is also created for the user, and the JSON for the last five bookmarks is inserted into "bookmarks" column of the profile.
* The user is redirected to example.com/profile/username and the JSON for the last five bookmarks is displayed.
* The user's last five bookmarks should now always be visible at example.com/profile/username

To get the app running, one must:
* Update the callback URL, secret, and key in readability.py
* Update database config in settings.py
* Update static media config in settings.py
* Create other views (such as the index view)

Other notes:
* You probably would not want the fetching of Readability data to be a blocking call as is shown in this app.  Instead, you might use an asynchronous task queue like Celery (http://ask.github.com/celery/getting-started/introduction.html).
* You'll likely also want to implement some access control mechanisms so users can keep their profiles private.
